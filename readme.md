TKP is website built with html5 used to display a directory of links on the dark web and what they lead to. These links are regularly tested, and viewing dark net sites is not illegal. However let it be known that in the case of you breaking the law, and ordering things from any of the websites linked that I will not be held liable for it. 

- Expirience the dark web
- Trusted links from a cybersecruity pro 
- Easy to access 100s of darknet sites & forum


> The overriding goal for TKP is 
> a reliable source of links for
> clear navigation of the darknet 

And of course TKP itself is open source with a 
[public repository][thekrispages]
 on GitHub.
